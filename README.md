# Elevator-simulator
I wrote a code which helps me to learn TKinter. In the algorithm; an elevator moving up and down along 3 floors, you can see the floor the where the elevator is and there is a "stop at the right time" system. I got help from AI only for TKinter but I set up the algorithm myself. I learned basics of TKinter and canvas, GUI, synchronous motion cycle.
